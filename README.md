### Abstract
We study changes in websites and the web technology industry with the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We follow more than 110,000 websites and their third-party HTTP requests for 18 months and show that websites substantially reduced their interactions with web technology vendors after the GDPR became effective. Importantly, this also holds for websites not legally bound by the GDPR. We document that these changes are especially pronounced regarding the collection of personal data, which is also reflected in changes in the stated privacy policies of web technology vendors. Finally, we document an increase in market concentration in web technology services after the introduction of the GDPR. While all firms suffer losses, the dominant vendor, Google, loses relatively less and can significantly increase market share in important markets such as advertising and analytics.
